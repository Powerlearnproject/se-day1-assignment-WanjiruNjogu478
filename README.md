#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

The methodical application of engineering principles to software design, development, maintenances h, testing, and evaluation. It entails using methodical techniques to produce software that is scalable, dependable, and effective.

importance 
It makes it possible to develop intricate software systems that underpin almost all contemporary technology. 
It offers strategies for overseeing complex software projects involving numerous developers. 
It guarantees that software security, dependability, and performance requirements are fulfilled.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The NATO software engineering conferences (1968-1969)The "software crisis" and the necessity of engineering discipline in software development were first formally acknowledged at these conferences. They made software engineering a separate discipline. 

Structured programming was first introduced in the 1970s. Writing software was radically altered by the transition from unstructured "spaghetti code" to structured programming. Principles like abstraction, modularity, and top-down design were founded by Edsger Dijkstra and others and are still fundamental today.

Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)
The mainstream adoption of object-oriented programming languages like C++ and later Java transformed software design by organizing code around data structures (objects) rather than functions, improving reusability and maintenance.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.Requirements Analysis: Gathering and documenting what the software should do
Design: Creating architecture and detailed specifications
Implementation: Writing the actual code
Testing: Verifying that the software works as intended
Deployment: Releasing the software to users
Maintenance: Updating and fixing the software throughout its lifecycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

In waterfall, there is final testing stage while in agile continuous testing.

In waterfall, there is ess client involvement during development while in agile there is stakeholder involvement.

waterfall is appropriate for projects with well-understood, stable requirements while agile methodology is appropriate for projects with evolving requirements


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer
Writing and maintaining code
Implementing software designs
Debugging and troubleshooting
Code reviews and refactoring
Unit testing

Quality Assurance Engineer
Designing and implementing test plans
Creating automated test suites
Identifying and reporting defects
Verifying bug fixes
Ensuring software meets quality standards

Project Manager
Planning project scope and schedules
Resource allocation
Risk management
Coordinating team activities
Stakeholder communication
Monitoring progress against milestones


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs combine code editors, compilers, debuggers, and other tools to streamline development.
Examples:
Visual Studio (for .NET development)
Pycharm

VCS track changes to code, enabling collaboration and providing backup mechanisms.
Examples:Git, Azure DevOps.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenge: Changing Requirements
Solutions:

Adopt agile methodologies
Build modular, extensible systems
Maintain clear communication channels with stakeholders
Use feature flags to manage incremental deployments

Challenge: Technical Debt
Solutions:

Schedule regular refactoring sessions
Maintain comprehensive test coverage
Document code thoroughly

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components in isolation to verify they work as expected.
Importance: Catches bugs early in the development process.

Integration Testing: Testing how components work together.
Importance: Identifies interface issues between modules.

Acceptance Testing: testing with real users to ensure the system satisfies business requirements.
Importance: Confirms the software meets user needs and expectations.

System Testing: Testing the complete, integrated system.
Importance: Verifies the system meets all requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering is the process in which you guide generative artificial intelligence to generate desired outputs.

importance 
It increases the chances of a person giving a correct response.

It reduces the possibilities of errors being made thus saving on time.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Poor prompt: Explain marketing strategies.
Improved prompt: Discuss 3 digital marketing strategies uses for e-commerce businesses.

The improved prompt is more effective because AI model generate more relevant and detailed responses
